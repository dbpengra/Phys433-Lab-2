    "### Make a function that uses the interval distribution to make a count distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a little tricky.  The **interval** distribution is a list of (real, positive) numbers, each one representing the **time between successive pulses**.  Your goal is to create a new array of (positive) **integers** where each number corresponds to the number of counts in a succession of fixed-length intervals.  This would be called a **count** distribution.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To make this, you need an algorithm. Imagine laying the interval distribution out along a time line.  The `*` represent a pulse at a particular time.  The interval distribution comes from the time between each `*`.  Then match it to a succession of fixed-length intervals. The fixed-length intervals are represented by the bar lines `|`:\n",

For example, above, we see 3 counts in fixed-interval 1, 2 in fixed-interval 2, 4 in 3, 0 in 4, 2 in 5, etc. This list of integers would be the count distribution for the particular fixed-interval length.  You can see that if the fixed intervals were of a different length, the count distribution would also be different.\n",

    "         * Add the number in *this_intervals_counts* to the count distribution array in by appending it as an array element. \n",
    "         * Then reset *this_intervals_counts* to 1, because it will go into the next (or higher) interval. \n",
    "         * Finally, add a fixed-interval-length to *fixedIntervalSum*.\n",
    "   3. Enter a `while` loop to add empty intervals to the count distribution array until *fixedIntervalSum* is greated than *intervalDistributionSum*:\n",
    "      1. Increment *fixedIntervalSum* by a fixed-interval-length.\n",
    "      2. append a 0 to the count distribution array.\n",
    "   4. Once *fixedIntervalSum* is greater than *intervalDistributionSum*, continue with the next interval in the `for` loop by adding it to *intervalDistributionSum*.\n",
